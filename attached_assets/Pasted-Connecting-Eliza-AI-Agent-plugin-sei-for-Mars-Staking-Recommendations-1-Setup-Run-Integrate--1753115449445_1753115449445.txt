Connecting Eliza AI Agent (plugin-sei) for Mars² Staking Recommendations
🌟 1. Setup: Run/Integrate the Eliza Agent for Sei
Add the plugin to your agent project:

text
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-sei
GitHub:
https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-sei

NPM:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elizaos/plugin-sei

Set up required environment variables:

text
SEI_PRIVATE_KEY=your_testnet_private_key
SEI_NETWORK=testnet
Use a funded testnet key for the agent (never a user’s key).

Register the plugin inside your Eliza agent configuration:

js
import { seiPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-sei";
export default {
    plugins: [seiPlugin],
    // ... any other plugins
};
See reference:
https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-sei

Start your Eliza agent service:
For example:

text
pnpm start --character="characters/sample.character.json"

🌈 2. User Flow: Mars² + Eliza Agent
User Experience Sequence:

User connects MetaMask in Mars² frontend

Agent is called with the user’s public Sei EVM address

Agent fetches:

All current delegations (validators + SEI amount) for that address

Mars² score/status for each of those validators

Agent returns an array of:

Validator name / address

User’s staked amount

Status (green/yellow/red)

Personalized action recommendation

Frontend renders recommendations, each with “Unstake,” “Redelegate,” and “See Incidents” buttons
Example output:

text
RHINO (Red) — High risk! We recommend unstaking.
[Unstake]  [Redelegate]  [See Incidents]
🧠 3. Eliza Agent Logic: Fetch Delegations, Scores, and Generate Advice
A. Fetching user staking positions
You need an API call or JSON-RPC query for all active delegations for a Sei address.

Sei explorer API reference: https://sei.explorers.guru/api/validators

Staking positions: You may fetch userDelegations with e.g.

text
GET https://sei.explorers.guru/api/accounts/{yourAddress}/delegations
or query a similar endpoint via REST or JSON-RPC.

Example (node.js fetch):

js
async function getDelegations(userAddress) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://sei.explorers.guru/api/accounts/${userAddress}/delegations`);
  const data = await res.json();
  // data.delegations is typically array of { validator_address, shares, ... }
  return data.delegations || [];
}
B. Fetch Mars² Status For Each Validator
You’ll need access to MarsValidatorScore.sol:

Contract address: 0x2358F2a3A43aa1aD43A1B6A04D52E26b7c37B294

Network: Sei EVM testnet (https://evm-rpc.testnet.sei.io)

Using ethers.js:

js
import { ethers } from "ethers";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://evm-rpc.testnet.sei.io");
const abi = [ "function getScore(address validator) public view returns (int256)" ];
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  "0x2358F2a3A43aa1aD43A1B6A04D52E26b7c37B294",
  abi,
  provider
);

async function getValidatorScore(validatorAddress) {
  const score = await contract.getScore(validatorAddress);
  return Number(score);
}
C. AI Agent: Generate Recommendations
For each delegation:

If score >= 80: Recommend “No action needed”

If score 50–79: Recommend “Monitor, consider reducing delegation”

If score < 50: Recommend “Unstake immediately, incident detected”

Example agent function:

js
function actionRecommendation(score) {
  if (score >= 80) return "🟢 Healthy — no action needed.";
  if (score >= 50) return "🟡 Moderate risk. Monitor or reduce stake.";
  return "🔴 High risk! Unstake immediately and review incidents.";
}
⚡ 4. Leverage Eliza’s Conversational UI
When the frontend connects the wallet, it sends the address to the Eliza agent by POST (or via internal API call depending on your setup).

Pseudo-code:

js
const userDelegations = await getDelegations(userAddress);
const recommendations = await Promise.all(
  userDelegations.map(async (d) => {
    const score = await getValidatorScore(d.validator_address);
    return {
      validator: d.validator_address,
      staked: d.shares,
      score,
      action: actionRecommendation(score)
    }
  }
));
The Eliza agent can wrap this reasoning in natural language and optionally offer actions:

“Click Unstake to move your funds, Redelegate to choose a safer validator, or See Incidents to review recent issues.”

💻 5. Mars² Frontend Integration
On wallet connect:

Call the agent endpoint with the user’s wallet address

Show a recommendations panel listing:

Validator name/address

Staked amount

Mars² score (with color badge)

Next action message (as returned above)

Buttons:

[Unstake] (links to Sei protocol’s unstake)

[Redelegate] (goes to Sei delegation UI / Mars² redelegation modal)

[See Incidents] (shows incident log/zk reports for this validator)

React Sketch:

jsx
<ValidatorRecommendation
  validator="RHINO"
  staked="1000"
  score={45}
  action="🔴 High risk! Unstake immediately and review incidents."
  onUnstake={() => openUnstakeFlow("RHINO")}
  onRedelegate={() => openRedelegateFlow("RHINO")}
  onSeeIncidents={() => showIncidentModal("RHINO")}
/>
📒 6. Improve the User Flow in Mars²
Before:

User sees live validator list, must manually check each stake, open incidents table, and decide what to do

With Eliza agent:

On wallet connect, the app auto-advises each user where their risk is, with personalized clear step-by-step actions

Smart call-to-action buttons let the user instantly act on advice

Agent can answer “Why should I unstake?” or “Who is safest today?” with up-to-date, AI-powered reasoning

✅ Summary Checklist for Replit
 Install and configure Eliza agent with @elizaos/plugin-sei

 Fetch user delegations via Sei REST/JSON-RPC

 Fetch Mars² score for each delegated validator

 Agent outputs plain-English recommendations per validator

 Frontend displays each with color, amount, next steps, and incident/action buttons

 Optionally, provide a conversational chat/FAQ powered by Eliza agent for followup (“Why this risk?”, “Should I unstake?”)
