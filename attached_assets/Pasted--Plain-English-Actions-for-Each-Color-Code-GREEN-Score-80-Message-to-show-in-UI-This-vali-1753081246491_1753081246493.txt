🟡 YELLOW (Score between 50 and 79)
Message to show in UI:
“This validator’s status requires monitoring. Some incidents may be affecting performance.”

Choose a safer validator to delegate to.

🔁 How to Incorporate into Mars² App
Assume that scoreValidator() and scoreColor() are already implemented.

Here’s how to integrate the next actions and recommendations directly into the UI based on score color:

✅ A. Add Color-Based Message Logic
In ValidatorTable.jsx or ValidatorDetails.jsx, create:

js
const getNextActionMessage = (score) => {
  if (score >= 80) {
    return {
      title: "✅ Validator Health: Excellent",
      action: "You can stake confidently. No action is needed.",
      color: "green"
    };
  } else if (score >= 50) {
    return {
      title: "⚠️ Validator Health: Moderate Risk",
      action: "Monitor status and recent reports. Reduce stake if issues persist.",
      color: "yellow"
    };
  } else {
    return {
      title: "🚨 Validator Health: High Risk",
      action: "Unstake immediately. Check report history and validator messages.",
      color: "red"
    };
  }
};
✅ B. Render Recommendation Card in UI
Below each row/card or in a detailed modal:

jsx
const actionInfo = getNextActionMessage(score);

<div className={`status-card status-${actionInfo.color}`}>
  <h4>{actionInfo.title}</h4>
  <p>{actionInfo.action}</p>
  {score < 80 && <button onClick={() => openReportModal(validator)}>View Report Details</button>}
</div>
Apply styles for status-green, status-yellow, status-red as colored cards.

✅ C. Optional: Add Icon or Alert Badge
Next to high-risk validators:

jsx
{score < 50 && <span className="alert-badge">ALERT</span>}
