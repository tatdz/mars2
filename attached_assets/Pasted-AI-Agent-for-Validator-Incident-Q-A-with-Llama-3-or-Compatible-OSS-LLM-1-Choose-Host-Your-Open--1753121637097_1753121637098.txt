AI Agent for Validator Incident Q&A (with Llama 3 or Compatible OSS LLM)
1. Choose & Host Your Open Source Model
For local dev, use Ollama and pull Llama 3:

text
ollama pull llama3
Start Ollama server (by default runs at http://localhost:11434).

Or, use a third-party API compatible with OpenAI format (Together.ai, Groq, etc).

2. Prepare Inputs for Incident Questions
When the user clicks "Ask AI about incidents", trigger a handler that:

Knows which validator the user is asking about (keep validatorAddress or display name in state/context)

Fetches incident data for that validator:

Onchain events from Mars¬≤'s contract (ex: getEvents(address) on MarsValidatorScore.sol on Sei EVM testnet)

Optionally, static info (validator profile, current score)...

Example (JS/ethers):

js
import { ethers } from "ethers";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://evm-rpc.testnet.sei.io");
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  "0x2358F2a3A43aa1aD43A1B6A04D52E26b7c37B294",
  [ "function getEvents(address) view returns (tuple(string label,int256 delta,uint timestamp)[])" ],
  provider
);

async function fetchIncidents(validatorAddress) {
  const events = await contract.getEvents(validatorAddress);
  // events: Array of {label, delta, timestamp}
  return events;
}
3. Build the User Flow (Frontend UI)
Display a button on validator cards/details:
[Ask AI about incidents]

When clicked:

Shows a sidebar/chat/modal

Calls fetchIncidents(validatorAddress) (see above)

Presents a ‚ÄúLoading AI‚Ä¶‚Äù spinner, then displays the AI answer

4. Compose an AI Prompt (System + Data) and Call Your LLM API
Create a well-structured prompt:

System instruction: The AI should answer as a Sei/Mars¬≤ staking assistant, using onchain event data.

Data context: All incident/event data just fetched.

User prompt: Original text, e.g. ‚ÄúWhat happened to this validator?‚Äù

Example prompt:

js
const aiPrompt = [
  { role: "system", content: `
    You are Mars¬≤, an expert on Sei validator risk and onchain incidents. 
    The user provided this validator's event history and asks a question. Summarize the risk in plain English, flag critical incidents, and explain how Mars¬≤ scores relate to the current status.
  `},
  { role: "user", content: `
    INCIDENTS DATA:
    ${JSON.stringify(events)}
    USER QUESTION: What incidents have affected this validator? Should I unstake?
  `}
];
Send prompt to your locally running Llama 3 (Ollama) instance:

js
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "llama3",
    messages: aiPrompt,
  }),
});
const data = await response.json();
const aiAnswer = data.choices[0].message.content;
For remote APIs:
Use the appropriate endpoint and adjust authentication.

5. Display the AI Answer in the UI
The AI‚Äôs response is shown in your sidebar/chat/modal, providing a natural-language explanation, flagged risks, advice to unstake/redelegate if score/risk warrants it.

Optionally, show prior Q&A context if user asks new questions (multi-turn).

Simple React snippet:

jsx
// In validator details component:
<button onClick={askAiHandler}>Ask AI about incidents</button>

// Chat/modal/popup:
<div>
  {isLoadingAI && <Spinner />}
  {aiAnswer && <div className="ai-chat-output">{aiAnswer}</div>}
</div>
6. Make It Multi-Turn and Deeply Conversational (Optional)
Keep a messages array for the chat (send the entire list as context each time).

Allow user to type follow-up questions (‚ÄúWhy did they get slashed?‚Äù etc.).

On each submit, pass the full context to the AI API for continuity.

Example End-to-End Flow
User clicks [Ask AI about incidents] for Validator RHINO.

Mars¬≤ UI fetches onchain events for RHINO, composes context as above.

Sends the prompt to your Llama 3 or OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The model responds:
‚ÄúValidator RHINO has experienced multiple missed-block incidents recently, a -10 score drop from a community report, and was slashed on July 8th. The current Mars¬≤ risk score is 39 (üî¥ Red). Based on Mars¬≤ policy, unstaking is advised.‚Äù

The UI shows this to the user, with buttons for follow-up: ‚ÄúWhat does slashing mean?‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow redelegate options‚Äù, etc.

Summary Checklist for Replit Implementation
 Host an open source LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama or compatible API)

 In Mars¬≤ UI, on ‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù button:

Fetch incident event data from chain

Send prompt to AI with system role & incident context

 Display AI response conversationally to the user

 Allow follow-up questions, keeping chat context alive
