# üöÄ Mars¬≤ ‚Äî Secure Staking Intelligence for Sei

Mars¬≤ is a real-time, onchain risk radar for validators on the Sei EVM network.
It gives delegators live color-coded trust scores, enables anonymous (Sybil-resistant) incident reports, and provides validators with a shared encrypted communication channel to coordinate in emergencies‚Äîall fully deployed and verifiable on Sei testnet.

üéØ Stake confidently. Report anonymously. Coordinate securely.

## Features

- **Real-time Validator Monitoring**: Live scoring system with color-coded risk assessments

- **Encrypted Group Messaging**: Secure validator communication with key management
- **MetaMask Integration**: Wallet connectivity for Sei EVM testnet

## Smart Contracts

Mars¬≤ uses three main contracts deployed on Sei EVM Testnet (Atlantic-2):

| Contract | Address | Description |

| **MarsValidatorScore** | `0x2358F2a3A43aa1aD43A1B6A04D52E26b7c37B294` | Validator scoring and updates |
| **MarsZkAttest** | `0x45d1DfaC9051d1B2552126D68caD5E6d3B9c5Cae` | Anonymous incident reporting |
| **MarsValidatorGroupMessages** | `0x9FE44Ee4805318bc5093A1daE2cc42A519dDD950` | Encrypted group messaging |

- ZK-proof simulation for anonymous reporting

## Hosting the Application

After completing the installation steps above, you can host Mars¬≤ in several ways:

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Production Deployment

#### Option 1: Replit Hosting (Recommended)
1. Fork this repository on Replit
2. The application will automatically install dependencies
3. Click "Run" to start the server
4. Your app will be hosted at `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co`

#### Option 2: Traditional Hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your hosting provider
3. Ensure your hosting provider supports Node.js for the backend API

#### Option 3: Self-Hosted Server
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Configure your domain and SSL certificates
4. Set up a reverse proxy (nginx recommended)

### Environment Variables
For production deployments, configure these environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (optional, uses memory storage if not set)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for production builds
- `PORT`: Server port (defaults to 5000)

## User Flow Guides

### For Stakers ü™ô

**Getting Started:**
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect MetaMask" and approve the Sei testnet configuration
2. **Browse Validators**: View the real-time validator dashboard with color-coded scores
3. **Understand the Scoring**:
   - üü¢ **Green (80-100)**: Safe validators to stake with
   - üü° **Yellow (50-79)**: Monitor closely, moderate risk  
   - üî¥ **Red (0-49)**: High risk, consider unstaking

**Monitoring Your Stakes:**
1. Click the info button (‚ÑπÔ∏è) next to any validator for detailed score breakdowns
2. Monitor your chosen validators regularly for score changes
3. Use the network stats sidebar to understand overall network health

**Reporting Issues:**
1. Navigate to any validator's row in the dashboard
2. Click the yellow warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) to report an incident
3. Select incident type (missed blocks, downtime, governance issues, etc.)
4. Provide a detailed description of the issue you observed
5. Submit report - your identity remains completely anonymous
6. The validator's score will update automatically if the report is verified

### For Validators ‚ö°

**Account Setup:**
1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask with your validator operator account
2. **Monitor Your Score**: Find your validator in the dashboard and track your performance
3. **Understand Score Factors**: Uptime, missed blocks, governance participation, and incident reports

**Encrypted Messaging:**
1. Navigate to the "Messaging" page
2. **Generate Keys**: Click "Generate New Keys" to create your encryption keypair
3. **Import Validator Keys**: Add public keys from other validators you want to communicate with
4. **Send Messages**: Compose encrypted messages for coordination and emergency communication
5. **Decrypt Messages**: View and decrypt messages sent to you by other validators

**Incident Response:**
1. Monitor your score for any negative changes
2. Check for incident reports that may affect your rating
3. Use the messaging system to coordinate with other validators during network issues
4. Maintain high uptime and active governance participation

**Best Practices:**
- Keep your validator running with high uptime (99%+ recommended)
- Participate actively in governance proposals
- Respond professionally to any incident reports
- Use encrypted messaging for sensitive coordination
- Regularly backup your encryption keys

### Anonymous Reporting Flow üîí

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Identify Issue**: Observe problematic validator behavior (downtime, missed blocks, etc.)
2. **Access Report Form**: Click the warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) next to the validator
3. **Select Issue Type**: Choose from predefined categories or select "Other"
4. **Provide Details**: Write a detailed description (minimum 10 characters)
5. **Submit Anonymously**: Your report is submitted with zero-knowledge proof verification
6. **Automatic Processing**: The system verifies the report and updates the validator's score
7. **Monitor Resolution**: Check if the validator addresses the reported issue

**Privacy Protection:**
- Your wallet address is never revealed in reports
- Zero-knowledge proofs prevent double-reporting while maintaining anonymity
- All reports are Sybil-resistant to prevent spam attacks
- Report authenticity is cryptographically verified
- AES-256 encryption simulation for messaging

## Demo Features
